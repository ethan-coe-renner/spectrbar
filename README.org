#+TITLE: Spectrbar
#+SUBTITLE: A rust library for creating spectrwm baraction binaries


**Still in Development**
[[https://github.com/conformal/spectrwm][Spectrwm]] provides a very simple way to use scripts to display information
in its bar. However, the syntax for colors, fonts, etc creates lots of
boilerplate tags necessary in the script. This library is intended
to remove all this boilerplate so that a spectrwm bar can be created
easily in rust.
